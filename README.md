# SassShop AKA Getting Sassy with CSS

This Sass curriculum was originally prepared for Girl Develop It Detroit by Julie Cameron, and further modified for various conferences and audiences, including SassConf 2015. The course is intended as an introductory session lasting 3-8 hours, depending on the crowd.

### Abstract

I don't know about you, but vanilla CSS always leaves me wanting more.  It's a fairly simple language, can do some pretty powerful things, but after a while.. well, it can become rather tedious to work with.  Enter Sass: Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets.  Sass is a CSS meta-language and precompiler that makes the prettification of your website a breeze by adding invaluable features of more traditional programming languages.  In this workshop, we'll jump right in to the Sass workflow and cover all the key game changers - nesting, variables, mixins, inheritance, and directives.  We'll also cover some of the gotchyas, tools and extensions, and tips on organization and coding standards.
